# bestemmiator-bot
*That's a bad thing, I know*

A nasty Discord bot. Useful when creativity isn't enough. Italian only, sorry fellas.

## Installation 
`pip install -U discord.py python-dotenv`

create a `.env` file and put `DISCORD_TOKEN=yourTokenHere`. You can retrive the token from Discord API page.

Once added in the server `!help` command will show you some options.
